        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salmon</li>
            <li>Balsamic Vinegar</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Dijon Mustard</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>In a small saucepan, saute garlic in olive oil.</li>
            <li>Now, add the rest of the balsamic glaze ingredients: balsamic vinegar, honey (or maple syrup or brown sugar), Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Bring the balsamic mixture to a simmer, then let reduce for 4 minutes, until it forms a sticky glaze. Do not let the balsamic reduce too long, or it may seize.</li>
            <li>Drizzle on the balsamic reduction, brushing the salmon filets generously.</li>
            <li>Bake balsamic salmon at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, until its internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F on an instant read thermometer (salmon is considered cooked at 145 degrees F but its temperature will rise as it rests).</li>
            <li>Five minutes into the cooking time, baste the salmon with the balsamic sauce again.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh parsley and serve. ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>
